## 🎯 Objectives
- Select a random element
- Conditional statements (if)

## ✔️ Specifications

### 🌱 Must-haves
#### 1️⃣  
- Three clickable buttons to pick their weapon of choice
- A play button to have the computer pick one random weapon
- Announce the winner
    - No alert box, add a message to your html
    - Possible outcomes: draw (when both chose the same thing) or player won/lost

#### 2️⃣  
- A play again button after a game ended
- Nice graphics
- Different end message styling, depending on the outcome
- Clean your code
    - Delete unused code or out-of-date comments
    - Try to write hard to understand parts in a way that's easier to understand for other developers
    - Can you use functions to make your code easier to read or reuse?

### 🌻 Nice-to-haves
- Add extra options for the player: lizard & spock
- Keep track of the score after multiple games
- Show what the player picked by highlighting the correct button
- Add more options for a player to choose from (example: a risky option that awards more points but has a higher chance of losing)
- Add even more options (but avoid using 100 if statements)
- Can you make a player win 100% of the games? Or win 75%? (not to raise any suspicion)
